### .Net 7.0 + Nunit + Rest Sharp
This is a Demo example of the minimal test project,
which shows how Rest Sharp library can be integrated with Nunit and .Net.
Project contains three demo tests with Fake API to show the geneal idea
of usage the Integration Testing technique.
Project also contains logger implementation as well as test configuration handling.
Potentially can be exptended to have report implementation
and communicaiton with database using Code First apporach. Also can be added
multi-environmental switch option to provide ability to quickly change environments
during the test implementation and to simplify integraiton with CI/CD.
